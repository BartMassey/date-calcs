# Date Calculations In Haskell
Copyright &copy; 2015 Bart Massey

This started out as some Haskell date calculations posted on
Google+ by Adrian "Boom" Nwk. I almost completely rewrote
them to get this version. The basic calculation structure
for `Date` `toEnum` is from the code referenced by this
StackOverflow [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11188621/).
